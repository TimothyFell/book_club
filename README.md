Book Club is a web application that allows visitors to add books, authors, and book
reviews to a database via a styled user interface. Visitors navigate through a main
book index page, sort books by various parameters, as well as view individual pages
for authors, books, and users.

Book Club was built using Rails version 2.4 and PostgreSQL, and utilizes Cabybara
for testing. Run 'rails db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}' to populate the database,
and run 'rspec' in the root directory to run the test suite.
